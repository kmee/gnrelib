Introduction
==============

gnrelib helps to process XML instance documents that obey the
gnre XML schema.

With gnrelib (gnrelib.py) you can write
Python code to:

- Parse an XML document that obeys the gnre XML schema,
  creating instances of the Python classes that represent the types
  defined in the gnre schema.  These Python classes are
  defined in gnrelib.py.

- Create instances of classes that represent the types described in
  the gnre XML schema.

- Write Python application code that uses the classes that
  represent gnre types.

- Export the objects to an XML document.


Schemas
---------

The gnrelib.py module in this package was generated from the
XML schemas in ./schemas.


generateDS.py
---------------

The gnrelib.py module in this package was generated by
generateDS.py.  You can learn about generateDS.py here:
